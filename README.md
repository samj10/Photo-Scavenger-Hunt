# Project 4 - Photo Scavenger Hunt

Submitted by: Samyak Jain

This project is a photo scavenger hunt app that allows users to view a list of tasks, tap into a task to see its details, and attach a photo to the task to mark it as completed. Completed tasks are visually distinguished in the task list, and the location of the attached photo is displayed on a map as a custom annotation. The app uses PHPicker to select photos, MapKit to display custom annotations on a map, and a custom data model to store tasks. There are also stretch features such as opening the camera for the user to take a photo instead of choosing from the photo library.

Time spent: 3 hours spent in total
